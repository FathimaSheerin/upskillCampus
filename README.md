Prediction of Agriculture Crop Production in India	

Data Preprocessing
1. Load the dataset using pandas
Use pandas to load your dataset into a DataFrame.
2. Handle missing values
Identify and handle missing values in the dataset appropriately.
3. Convert the "Season" column to the appropriate format
Convert the "Season" column into a numerical format representing the number of days.
4. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations
Use techniques like one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables (e.g., "Variety," "State," "Recommended Zone") into numerical representations.

Feature Selection and Engineering
Relevant Features
Determine which features are relevant for predicting crop production. Potentially relevant features might include:
	"Variety"
 	"State"
	"Season
 	"Recommended Zone"
	"Cost"


Model Selection
Experiment with different machine learning models to determine the best predictor for crop production:
1. Decision Tree
2. Naive Bayes
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression
5. Random Forest
6. XGBoost
